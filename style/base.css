    Using !important is bad practice and should generally be avoided.
    I opted to use it here because some of the JupyterLab CSS selectors are extremely specific and hard
    to overrule, but if we find ourselves significantly modifying this file or ever running into
    conflicts, we should make these selectors more specific and drop !important
